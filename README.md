Remember to run 'bundle install' before you start your rails server 

!!When you're confused about something in this rails application, it's works to put 'debugger' close to the 
 code you think might be causing the problem. Inspecting the state of the system using 'byebug' is a powerful
 method for traking down application errors and interacivity while debugging. There's alot of documentation 
 for this in rails.
