Remember to run 'bundle install' before you start your rails server 

!!When you're confused about something in this rails application, it's works to put 'debugger' close to the 
 code you think might be causing the problem. Inspecting the state of the system using 'byebug' is a powerful
 method for traking down application errors and interacivity while debugging. There's alot of documentation 
 for this in rails.

List of common git commands

git status                        #shows all changed files in your directory
git add -A                        # adds all the files changed and pushed to the commit stage
git status                        # so you can double check if files have been added (if they are they 
                                    will be green if not then red)
git commit -m "your message"      # the commit message
